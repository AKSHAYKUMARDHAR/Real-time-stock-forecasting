📈 Project Description

End-to-End Stock Price Forecasting Pipeline is a production-structured, database-backed time-series machine learning system designed to predict future stock prices using both statistical and deep learning approaches.

The project implements a complete ML lifecycle, beginning with automated historical market data ingestion from the Alpha Vantage API, followed by structured storage in a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature preparation, and time-series validation before training forecasting models.

Two modeling approaches are implemented:

1.ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for statistical time-series forecasting

2.LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for capturing nonlinear patterns and long-term temporal dependencies

The system supports iterative multi-step forecasting, enabling prediction of future stock prices without retraining the model. Trained models and preprocessing scalers are serialized for deployment-ready inference.

Key Highlights:

1. API-driven data ingestion pipeline

2. PostgreSQL database integration

3. Time-series preprocessing & visualization

4. Statistical and deep learning model comparison

5. Model persistence for scalable deployment

6. Modular, production-oriented architecture

7. This project demonstrates strong skills in data engineering, time-series analysis, deep learning, database management, and end-to-end machine learning system design.
